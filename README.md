### Howdy! Welcome to my :octocat:GitHub profile:octocat:   

#### whoami:   
I'm a Go backend developer living in Lisbon, Portugal :portugal:. I've been working in IT since 2008.   
I started with Borland Delphi / Object Pascal, Then migrated to C/Lua and after it Mendix Low-Code Platform. Since the end of 2018 I've been dedicating all my free time to learning the Go programming language. I'm also a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/gliderspace). I've covered the Lua programming language, from basic to Advanced for two years and now I cover Go programming.   

#### Bonus info:   
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing my first Open Source project, called [CollabYT](https://github.com/collabyt/Backend), it is a two person job, I'm doing the backend and Domain Modeling using [Go](https://golang.org) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), while [Luma Vitorino](https://github.com/lumaVitorino) works on the frontend stuff.   

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my project, [CollabYT](https://github.com/collabyt/Backend). Not as much in the codebase, but with mentoring on how to proceed.
