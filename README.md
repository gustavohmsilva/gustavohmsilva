### Howdy! Welcome to my :octocat:GitHub profile:octocat:   

#### whoami:   
I'm a Go backend developer living in Lisbon, Portugal :portugal:. I've been working in IT since 2008 and I'm currently working at [@teamwork](https://github.com/Teamwork).   
I started with Borland Delphi / Object Pascal, Then migrated to C/Lua and after it Mendix Low-Code Platform. Since the end of 2018 I've been dedicating all my free time to learning the Go programming language. I'm also a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/gliderspace). I've covered the Lua programming language, from basic to Advanced for two years and now I cover Go programming.   

#### Bonus info:   
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing my second Open Source project, called [TechCheck](https://github.com/gustavohmsilva/TechCheck). It is currently being implemented in Go using the Echo Framework. My first Open Source projetct, called [CollabYT](https://github.com/collabyt/Backend), is on hold while the Frontend development advances. A complete refactor is being planned tho. As he isn't ready for production environment yet.   

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my project [TechCheck](https://github.com/gustavohmsilva/TechCheck)! If you are a Frontend developer interested in having a go with it, let me know and I'll transfer [TechCheck](https://github.com/gustavohmsilva/TechCheck) for an organization account and include you as part of the project.
