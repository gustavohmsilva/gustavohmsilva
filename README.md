### Welcome to my :octocat:GitHub profile:octocat:   

#### Who am I:   
I'm a Go and Lua developer living in Lisbon, Portugal :portugal:. I've been working in IT since 2008 and I'm currently working at [@teamwork](https://github.com/Teamwork).   
I started with Borland Delphi / Object Pascal, Then migrated to Lua and since the end of 2019 I've been dedicating all my free time learning the Go programming language. I used to have a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/gliderspace) where I covered the Lua programming language, from basic to Advanced for two years and after that I did a lot of videos covering the Go programming language.
