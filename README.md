### Welcome to my :octocat:GitHub profile:octocat:   

#### Who am I:   
I'm a Go and Lua developer living in Lisbon, Portugal :portugal:. I've been working with Programming since 2008 and I'm currently building amazing things at [@Mindera](https://github.com/Mindera).   
I started with Borland Delphi / Object Pascal, then migrated to Lua and since the end of 2019 I've been dedicating all my time to the Go programming language (golang). I have a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/gliderspace) where I covered Lua programming language, from basic to Advanced for two years and now I do occasional videos covering Go.

Due to my work on YouTube, I've been awarded by [EPIC](https://www.epicgames.com/) with a Grant from their [EPIC Mega Grants](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants) program in 2021.
